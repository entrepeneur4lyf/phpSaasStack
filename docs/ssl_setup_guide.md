# SSL/TLS Setup Guide

1. Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate:
   - You can get a free certificate from Let's Encrypt (https://letsencrypt.org/)
   - Or purchase one from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)

2. Install the certificate on your server:
   - Place the certificate file (usually with .crt extension) in a secure location
   - Place the private key file (usually with .key extension) in a secure location
   - Ensure the web server process has read access to these files

3. Update the Swoole server configuration in `public/index.php`:
   - Set the correct paths for 'ssl_cert_file' and 'ssl_key_file'

4. Configure your web server (if using one in front of Swoole):
   - If you're using Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy, configure them to use the SSL certificate

5. Test your HTTPS setup:
   - Visit https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ and enter your domain
   - Address any issues reported by the SSL test

6. Set up automatic renewal for your SSL certificate:
   - If using Let's Encrypt, set up a cron job to run certbot renewal

7. Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection:
   - This is handled by the HttpsRedirectMiddleware in our application

8. Consider implementing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):
   - This can be done by adding appropriate headers in your responses

Remember to keep your SSL certificates and private keys secure and up to date!
