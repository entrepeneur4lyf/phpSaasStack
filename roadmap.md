Let's create a Software As A Service project to develop a comprehensively featured digital marketplace with AI features (chat, coding, moderation, image generation, etc.) using PHP 8.2, MySQL and Swoole. I would like the application to serve html in real-time without the necessity to reload the page using AlpineJS Ajax, with Shoelace WebComponents.
