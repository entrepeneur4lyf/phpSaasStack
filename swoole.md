# Swoole Implementation Tasks

## 1. WebSocket Integration
- [ ] Add WebSocket handler to the existing Swoole HTTP server in `public/index.php`
- [ ] Implement WebSocket open, message, close, and error event handlers
- [ ] Create a WebSocket connection manager to track active connections
- [ ] Implement authentication for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Develop a protocol for WebSocket messages (e.g., JSON-based with message types)
- [ ] Create a WebSocket client for the frontend (using JavaScript)
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging for WebSocket events
- [ ] Add SSL/TLS support for secure WebSocket connections

## 2. Router Adaptation
- [ ] Extend the existing Router class to handle WebSocket routes
- [ ] Create a WebSocketRouteCollection class
- [ ] Implement a method to register WebSocket routes with handlers
- [ ] Modify the Router's dispatch method to handle both HTTP and WebSocket requests
- [ ] Create a WebSocketRequest class to encapsulate WebSocket message data
- [ ] Implement middleware support for WebSocket routes
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid WebSocket routes

## 3. Controller Structure
- [ ] Refactor existing controllers to return data instead of echoing or requiring views
- [ ] Create base Controller class with common methods for Swoole compatibility
- [ ] Implement asynchronous methods in controllers where necessary
- [ ] Add support for Swoole's defer() and Co::create() in controllers
- [ ] Create WebSocketController base class for WebSocket-specific controllers
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and response formatting in controllers
- [ ] Add logging to controllers for better debugging and monitoring

## 4. View Rendering
- [ ] Research and choose a template engine compatible with Swoole (e.g., Twig, Latte)
- [ ] Implement the chosen template engine in the project
- [ ] Create a ViewRenderer class to handle view compilation and rendering
- [ ] Modify controllers to use the new ViewRenderer
- [ ] Implement caching for compiled views
- [ ] Create helper functions for use in views (e.g., asset(), url())
- [ ] Add support for layouts and partials in the view system
- [ ] Implement a method to pre-compile all views for production use

## 5. Session Handling
- [ ] Implement a custom SessionManager class compatible with Swoole
- [ ] Create a storage mechanism for sessions (e.g., Redis, Table)
- [ ] Implement session creation, retrieval, and destruction methods
- [ ] Add session garbage collection
- [ ] Implement session encryption for security
- [ ] Create middleware for session handling
- [ ] Add configurable session lifetime and cookie parameters
- [ ] Implement session locking to prevent race conditions

## 6. Database Connections
- [ ] Implement a database connection pool
- [ ] Create a CoroutineMySQLPool class for managing MySQL connections
- [ ] Modify the existing database service to use the connection pool
- [ ] Implement automatic connection retry and error handling
- [ ] Add support for transactions in the coroutine context
- [ ] Implement query logging and performance monitoring
- [ ] Create a database profiler for debugging and optimization
- [ ] Add support for multiple database connections (e.g., read/write splitting)

## 7. Error Handling
- [ ] Create a SwooleErrorHandler class
- [ ] Implement error and exception catching in the Swoole server
- [ ] Create custom exception classes for different error types
- [ ] Implement a logging mechanism for errors and exceptions
- [ ] Create an error reporting system (e.g., email notifications for critical errors)
- [ ] Implement a user-friendly error display for production
- [ ] Add detailed error information for development environment
- [ ] Create an error tracking system to aggregate similar errors

## 8. Configuration
- [ ] Implement a configuration caching system
- [ ] Create environment-specific configuration files
- [ ] Implement a ConfigurationManager class to handle configuration loading and caching
- [ ] Add support for .env file for sensitive configuration data
- [ ] Implement configuration reloading without server restart
- [ ] Create a command to clear configuration cache
- [ ] Add validation for critical configuration values
- [ ] Implement feature flags system for easy feature toggling

## 9. Dependency Injection
- [ ] Optimize the dependency injection container for long-running processes
- [ ] Implement lazy loading of services
- [ ] Create a method to refresh stateful services without server restart
- [ ] Implement scoped services (e.g., request-scoped, singleton)
- [ ] Add support for factories in the DI container
- [ ] Implement automatic dependency resolution based on type-hinting
- [ ] Create a command to generate dependency injection configuration
- [ ] Add support for tagged services and autoconfiguration

## 10. Chat Functionality
- [ ] Implement chat rooms using Swoole Tables or Redis
- [ ] Create methods for joining and leaving chat rooms
- [ ] Implement real-time message broadcasting to room participants
- [ ] Add support for private messaging between users
- [ ] Implement message persistence using the database
- [ ] Create an API for retrieving chat history
- [ ] Implement typing indicators and read receipts
- [ ] Add support for multimedia messages (e.g., images, files)
- [ ] Implement message encryption for enhanced security
- [ ] Create a message queueing system for offline users
