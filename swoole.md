- [x] Develop a protocol for WebSocket messages (e.g., JSON-based with message types)
- [x] Create a WebSocket client for the frontend (using HTMX and AlpineJS)
- [x] Implement error handling and logging for WebSocket events
- [x] Add SSL/TLS support for secure WebSocket connections

## 2. Router Adaptation
- [x] Extend the existing Router class to handle WebSocket routes
- [x] Create a WebSocketRouteCollection class
- [x] Implement a method to register WebSocket routes with handlers
- [x] Modify the Router's dispatch method to handle both HTTP and WebSocket requests
- [x] Create a WebSocketRequest class to encapsulate WebSocket message data
- [x] Implement middleware support for WebSocket routes
- [x] Add error handling for invalid WebSocket routes

## 3. Controller Structure
- [x] Refactor existing controllers to return data instead of echoing or requiring views
- [x] Create base Controller class with common methods for Swoole compatibility
- [x] Implement proper error handling and response formatting in controllers
- [x] Implement asynchronous methods in controllers where necessary
- [x] Add support for Swoole's defer() and Co::create() in controllers
- [x] Create WebSocketController base class for WebSocket-specific controllers
- [x] Add logging to controllers for better debugging and monitoring

## 4. View Rendering
- [x] Implement basic view rendering in the Controller base class

- [x] Implement caching for compiled views
- [x] Create helper functions for use in views (e.g., markdown filter)
- [x] Add support for layouts and partials in the view system
- [x] Implement a method to pre-compile all views for production use
- [x] Refactor existing views to use Twig with HTMX for websockets/SSE, AlpineJS and Shoelace with Webcomponents

## 5. Session Handling
- [x] Implement a custom SessionManager class compatible with Swoole
- [x] Create a storage mechanism for sessions (e.g., Redis, Table)
- [x] Implement session creation, retrieval, and destruction methods
- [x] Add session garbage collection
- [x] Implement session encryption for security
- [x] Create middleware for session handling

- [x] Update the Database class to work with CoroutineMySQLPool
- [x] Add support for transactions in the coroutine context
- [x] Implement query caching using CacheManager
- [x] Implement query logging and performance monitoring
- [x] Create a database profiler for debugging and optimization
- [x] Move Database class from Core to Database namespace
- [x] Add support for multiple database connections (e.g., read/write splitting)

## 7. Error Handling
- [x] Create a SwooleErrorHandler class
- [x] Implement error and exception catching in the Swoole server
- [x] Create custom exception classes for different error types
- [x] Implement a logging mechanism for errors and exceptions
- [x] Create an error reporting system (e.g., email notifications for critical errors)
- [x] Implement a user-friendly error display for production
- [x] Implement a detailed error information display for development environment
- [x] Create an error tracking system to aggregate similar errors

## 8. Configuration
- [x] Implement a configuration caching system
- [x] Create environment-specific configuration files
